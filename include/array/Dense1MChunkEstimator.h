 *  @description
 *  "Dense1M" is a static computation used in some contexts to compute
 *  chunk intervals not explicitly specified by the user.  It assumes
 *  that the array for which intervals are to be computed will hold
 *  dense data, with a cell count per chunk of one million---hence
 *  "Dense1M".
 *
 *  Dense1M works like this.  Suppose you have a schema with n
 *  dimensions, of which m â‰¤ n are unspecified.  Each of those m
 *  dimensions will be given the same chunk interval, computed as the
 *  m-th root of one million divided by the product of the specified
 *  intervals.  (The physical chunk size is pegged at one million, and
 *  the unspecified dimensions each take an equal proportion (m-th
 *  root) of what's left of the space after the specified dimensions
 *  have been factored out.)
 *
 *  @note The magic 1,000,000 number is no longer hardcoded, but is
 *  taken from the target-cells-per-chunk configuration parameter.

/**
 *  @brief Implement the "dense one million cell" chunk estimation computation.
 *
 *  @description
 *  Given a set of chunk intervals (possibly held in a Dimensions
 *  vector), compute the value of any unspecified chunk intervals.
 *  There are a couple of ways to do this.
 *
 *  If you have a Dimensions vector that may or may not have
 *  unspecified (that is, DimensionDesc::AUTOCHUNKED) intervals, you
 *  can estimate any missing intervals with a single call to the static
 *  estimate() method:
 *
 *  @code
 *  Dimensions& myDims = ... ;
 *  Dense1MChunkEstimator::estimate(myDims);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  If you must loop through the dimensions anyway (or if you don't
 *  yet have DimensionDesc objects, as is the case in the AST
 *  Translator), you can add intervals as you learn them and then
 *  estimate a result.  If there were no unspecified intervals, the
 *  result will be zero.
 *
 *  @code
 *  Dense1MChunkEstimator estimator;
 *  for (auto& thing : Things) {
 *      estimator.add(thing.chunkInterval());
 *  }
 *  int64_t result = estimator.estimate();
 *  if (result) {
 *      Dimensions& myDims = ...;
 *      for (auto& dim : myDims) {
 *          if (dim.isAutochunked()) {
 *              dim.setChunkInterval(result);
 *          }
 *      }
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The apply() method does that last "if (result) ..." for-loop for
 *  you, so instead you can write
 *
 *  @code
 *  Dense1MChunkEstimator estimator;
 *  for (auto& thing : Things) {
 *      estimator.add(thing.chunkInterval());
 *  }
 *  Dimensions& myDims = ...;
 *  estimator.apply(myDims);
 *  @endcode
